Looking after your skin is the single most important thing you can do to combat ageing.

It’s your skin care at home that gives you the best long-term results

Dr Caroline says the reason why your skin care at home is so important is, ‘it enables people to do something to their skin a couple of times a day. We often only get the chance at the clinic every few months. At Medical Skin Clinic Australia, we feel it is what you do at home that has the lasting effect. We can improve your skin concerns but if this is not maintained at home it can return’.

Whilst great skin care does not provide the instant results that many people want and expect from their [treatments and procedures](https://www.plasticsurgeryhub.com.au/cosmetic-procedures/), it does give you the best long-term outcomes. It is the without a doubt the most effective way to ward off signs of ageing. If you ask any beautiful woman what their secret is they’ll usually always give you two answers – drink lots of WATER and take the time and effort to have a good skincare regime. Caroline agrees, ‘Having a good home skin care regime is of utmost importance. After all, no current available skin treatment stops ageing or changes your cells DNA. Home maintenance can help improve current skin concerns, maintain the results of treatments and improve the outcome and longevity of treatments and injections’.

Dr Caroline makes an extremely important point that people should not expect quick changes when it comes to skincare. It’s all about long-term outcomes. And if you think about it, you’re in the skin you’ll have for life. She says, ‘be patient and give it time to work and time would be a minimum of 3 months’.

Dr Caroline goes on to say that it’s important you get the right skin care for you. It’s also important to regularly review your skin care to make sure it’s doing the right thing for your skin at the right time. She says, ‘Getting the correct ingredients, in the correct concentration and having regular reviews of the skincare can make massive differences to the skin and to everything we do to the skin at the clinic’.

Don’t forget your makeup is also part of your skin care regime

Dr Caroline says that many of us often forget that makeup is an essential part of our skincare routine. ‘Used daily by most, it is often the product that spends the longest time in contact with our skin. Having a poor makeup regime can have huge negative effects on our skin, causing congestion, dryness, acne or irritation to name a few. It’s not unusual to find clients applying makeup with abrasive chemicals or irritants in them or using products that are out of date. If we consider it correctly, how great would it be to use a product that gives us a great coverage and complexion whilst also restoring and protecting our skin?’

There are never-ending choices of skincare and makeup products out there and almost everyone will tell you a different one is best. A great place to start is to get the products individualised to your concerns by an expert like Dr Caroline and her staff at a skin clinic like Medical Skin Clinic in Victoria. They will be only too happy to give you a skin analysis and tell you what to look out for in your skin products. If you’d like to contact Dr Caroline give her clinic a call on (03) 5261 6171. All the clinic’s staff are trained in skincare and you can just drop in for a free consult at any time.
