# Belly Button Surgery – Baring Your Belly with Confidence

Australia is the land of the sun and showing off our bodies is a part of our lifestyle. Come the summertime we’re all hoping to look our best and show off our new pair of bikinis or tops that show a little (or big!) glimpse of our bellies! However, there are quite a few of us who don’t necessarily feel comfortable showing off our bellies. And it’s not always because we’re not happy with our weight. Belly buttons are those little things that can cause big concern. Dr Mark Hanikeri, Specialist Plastic Surgeon from Perth, WA, says he’s seeing more and more people come in for Belly Button Surgery or Belly Button Reshaping. We find out more.

### What is the belly button anyway?!

The belly button is the scar left from where the umbilical cord was cut to disconnect us from our mothers after we are born. Its appearance can be determined by genes (its height and position on your stomach is predetermined), but also by the way it was cut and tied by the doctor at your birth. Our belly buttons can also change their shape and appearance after massive weight loss or pregnancy. Some of us have ‘innies’ and some of us have ‘outies’.

While those of us who are happy with our belly buttons might find it hard to understand, for those of us who are unhappy it can affect confidence, self-esteem and even lead to the avoidance of wearing bikinis, short tops, low cut jeans, being intimate or even wearing tight clothes. The wonderful thing about modern-day plastic surgery is that there is a procedure to alter the size, shape and even position of your belly button. Not only can you change it from an ‘outie’ to an ‘innie’ but you can move it higher or lower depending on your preference.

Also known as an umbilicoplasty or bellybutton rejuvenation, it is often performed at the same time as an abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, but more and more people are having the procedure on its own. Dr Hanikeri says, ‘People are quite self-conscious if their belly button is prominent. Now they are looking up ways to improve it online and they know something can be done’.

### The Belly Button Reshaping Procedure

Unless there are other concerns, such as a hernia (often the cause of “outie” belly buttons) or it is being done as part of an abdominoplasty, the belly button reshaping procedure can be done under a local anaesthetic and doesn’t take more than an hour.

The procedure involves opening up the belly button stalk through a small incision at the bottom of the belly button, reducing the contents which are causing it to be prominent and reshaping the skin, suturing it down to the deeper tissues to improve the appearance.
