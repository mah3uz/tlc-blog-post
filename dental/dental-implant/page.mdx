A dental implant requires dental operation to replace a missing tooth. A piece of metal that resembles a screw is placed in the jaw where the missing toothâ€™s roots were. An artificial tooth, or crown, is then attached to the metal to fill in the gap.

There are two types of dental implants: endosteal implants, which are surgically implanted directly into the jaw bone, and subperiosteal implants, which consists of a metal frame that is fitted on the jawbone below the gum tissue.

Something as serious as an implant may wreak havoc on your finances. Call TLC today to discuss payment plans for your dental needs.
