# Weight Loss Surgery – Some Myths that Will Surprise You

Have you ever wondered what really happens during weight loss surgery? It’s a subject that often comes up in conversations but many don’t have all the facts. From misconceptions about diet and exercise to the safety of the procedure, there are so many myths surrounding this life-changing intervention. In this blog article, we will look at some of these common beliefs and take a closer look at the realities behind them. We’ll also explore some potential health benefits that come with weight loss surgery, as well as other factors to consider when making this important decision. So, if you’re wondering whether or not weight loss surgery is right for you, read on to discover the truth behind some surprising myths!

## How Effective Is Weight Loss Surgery?

Weight loss surgery is one of the most effective ways to lose weight and keep it off. Studies have shown that people who have weight loss surgery are more likely to maintain their weight loss long-term than those who don’t have surgery.

However, weight loss surgery is not a miracle cure. It’s important to remember that you will still need to make healthy lifestyle choices after your surgery in order to maintain your weight loss. Surgery is just one tool that can help you achieve your weight loss goals.

## Comprehensive Weight Loss Surgery Cost

The cost of weight loss surgery depends on several factors, such as your insurance coverage, the type of procedure you have, and the facility where you have the surgery. However, there are some general estimates that can give you an idea of what to expect.

According to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, the average cost of weight loss surgery is $17,000. This includes both the surgeon’s fees and the cost of the hospital stay. However, this is just an estimate, and your actual costs will depend on your individual situation.

If you have insurance coverage for [weight loss surgery](https://tlc.com.au/achieve-your-ideal-weight-with-weight-loss-surgery/), your out-of-pocket costs will be much lower. Most insurance plans will cover at least a portion of the surgery costs, and some will even cover all of them. If you don’t have insurance or if your plan doesn’t cover weight loss surgery, you may be able to get financial assistance from the facility where you have the surgery.

No matter what your financial situation is, it’s important to remember that weight loss surgery is an investment in your health. The long-term benefits far outweigh the short-term costs, so don’t let money stand in the way of getting the help you need.

## Some Weight Loss Surgery Options

There are a number of [weight loss surgery](https://tlc.com.au/getting-ready-for-weight-loss-surgery/) options available these days. Each one has its own set of pros and cons, so it’s important to do your research before deciding which one is right for you. Here are some of the most popular options:

Gastric bypass surgery: This surgery is also known as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. It involves creating a small pouch at the top of your stomach and attaching it directly to your small intestine. This reduces the amount of food your stomach can hold, which means you’ll feel fuller faster and eat less overall. Gastric bypass surgery can be an effective weight loss tool, but it comes with a risk of serious complications, including infection, blood clots, and malnutrition.

Gastric sleeve surgery: This surgery involves removing a large portion of your stomach, leaving only a narrow “sleeve” in its place. This not only reduces the amount of food your stomach can hold, but also limits the amount of nutrients your body can absorb. Gastric sleeve surgery is less likely to cause complications than gastric bypass surgery, but it’s also not as effective in terms of weight loss.
