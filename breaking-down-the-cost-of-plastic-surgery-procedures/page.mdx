Given the complexity of plastic and cosmetic surgery procedures and the various professionals involved in making it happen, it should come as no surprise as to why there are several things to consider when it comes to the costs involved. We spoke to Dr Patrick Briggs from Subiaco, WA who understands it can be hard for patients to wrap their head around the costs and wanted to help us break them down.

### Surgeon’s Fee

Each surgeon has his or her own fixed fee for every procedure. Do not hesitate to enquire about what this might be upfront, at your first consult. Dr Patrick Briggs also advises that you take time to ask the surgeon, or his staff, for a breakdown of costs that will be involved should you choose to go with that particular surgeon. Some surgeons will quote you their fee only (exclusive of the other cost considerations we have listed below) and some will have “package” prices that include all or most of what we have listed below.

### Anaesthetist Fee

Usually, charges are made on a per-hour basis. Learn the payment terms in detail.

### Hospital Stay

The cost of your hospital stay can vary greatly. It depends on some important factors: the complexity of the procedure, the time it takes to perform the procedure, the qualifications/location of the hospital itself, as well as the actual time you will need to spend in hospital (per night).

### Availability of Medicare and Other Health Funds

On average, funding costs are expected to differ based on the hospital and patient’s coverage. Not all procedures are qualified for Medicare funding – in fact, very few cosmetic surgery procedures are. Should your procedure be considered eligible, your health fund may cover a portion of your fees. To clarify your exact level of cost, review your policy thoroughly.

Dr Briggs suggests, “If a Medicare item number is applicable then a health fund will usually contribute towards your fees, depending on your policy and level of cover. Prices vary as they depend on the hospital used and individual’s level of cover. If you wish to obtain an estimation of fees my staff will always endeavour to give you a fair idea of what costs may be involved. Prices are often customised for multiple procedure surgeries depending on the patient’s needs and desires. Finalisation of costs of some procedures however may require a consultation, examination and determination of the applicability of a Medicare item number.”

### Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery Packages

Some surgeons, such as Dr Briggs, offer plastic and cosmetic surgery packages. These packages simplify the costings so you know how much you will be up for when it comes to the cost of your surgery. Dr Briggs’ packages cover the his fees, the anesthetist fees, your hospital fees plus 6 weeks of post-operative care. These are Dr Briggs’ prices only, and any packages that other surgeons offer may vary in price.

- Breast Augmentation Complete – $9,800
- Mastopexy (Breast Lift) – $10,000
- Mastopexy and Breast Augmentation – $15,500
- Bilateral Upper Blepharoplasty (Eyelids) – $3,500
- Bilateral Lower Blepharoplasty (Eyelids) – $3,500
- Bilateral Upper and Lower Blepharoplasty (Eyelids) – $5,800

Not all surgeons offer packages, so you need to check what’s included in any price that is quoted to you when you are researching your surgeon.
