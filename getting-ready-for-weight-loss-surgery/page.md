# Getting Ready For Weight Loss Surgery

Weight loss surgery includes a variety of procedures performed on people who have obesity. Weight loss is achieved by reducing the size of the stomach with a gastric band or through removal of a portion of the stomach or by respecting and re-routing the small intestine to a small stomach pouch. Surgery should be considered as a treatment option for patients with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater who instituted but failed an adequate exercise and diet program (with or without adjunctive drug therapy) and who present with obesity-related co morbid conditions, such as hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. A doctor–patient discussion of surgical options should include the long-term side effects, such as a possible need for reoperation, gallbladder disease, and malabsorption.

Patients should be referred to high-volume centers with surgeons experienced in bariatric surgery.

The surgery is contraindicated in patients who have end stage disease and also in patients not committed to make lifestyle changes considered ideal for the surgery.Doctors now consider Weight loss surgery to be the most effective and durable treatment for obesity, a disease that’s erupted into a full-blown epidemic. The argument in favor of the most effective Weight loss surgery procedures, the gastric sleeve and gastric bypass, is that on average, they help people lose about 30 percent of their original bodyweight and keep most of it off a far better outcome than a regimen of diet and exercise. They also have lower rates of obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, compared to people with obesity that doesn’t get the surgery.
