### Is it right to choose debt consolidation?

Many of us don’t know the importance of consolidation. It is the method through which multiple debts are consolidated into one single monthly payment. These are mainly done so that it reduces the interest rate and you can easily repay the amount. There are many benefits of debt consolidation which are as follows:

1.  **Single Payment –** If you have multiple loans, then it will be hard to keep in mind many due dates and its interest. When you consolidate the whole process will come under a single payment. Remembering single due date and the amount of interest will not be tough for anyone.
2.  **Reduced interest rate –** When you pay back the debt you can see that the amount required for the interest will be more. This is mainly because we would have got many debts. Thus if you wish to reduce this, consolidation will be the right choice. With it, there will be a decrease in overall interest rate.
3.  **Faster payback –** If you wish to pay back the debts when you do it individually for several loans it will take a longer period of time. But the consolidation will reduce almost 3-5 years in the overall years required to pay back the loans.
