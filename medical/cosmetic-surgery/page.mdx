Cosmetic surgery is a unique discipline of medicine that is focuses on enhancing appearances through a wide range of surgical and non-surgical procedures. Cosmetic surgery can be performed on all areas of the head, neck and body, and as these areas function properly, cosmetic surgery is elective. Some procedures can include breast augmentations, lift & reductions, liposuction, rhinoplasty, and injectable fillers.
