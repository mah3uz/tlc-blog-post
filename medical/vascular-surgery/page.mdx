A vascular surgeon is a surgeon specialising in the management of conditions relating to the blood vessels. Their expertise lies in performing procedures to better improve blood circulation around the body as well as the diagnosis and management of diseases pertaining to all parts of the vascular system excluding the brain and heart.

Vascular surgery is a surgical subspecialty concerned with the diseases relating to the vascular system including the arteries, veins and lymphatic circulation. These can be managed by medical therapy, minimally-invasive catheter procedures and surgical reconstruction.
