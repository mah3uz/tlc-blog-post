# \* When Will You Need a Vascular Surgery Loan?

Imagine that you are flying in a helicopter over one of the busy cities. Looking down what you will see? You will find the major expressways and the smaller highways exiting off of them and you can also see the roads. Confused about why I am asking this? Know that this is one of the best ways to think about our circulatory system which includes the arteries and veins which do the critical job of transporting blood throughout the body.

With this example, like a traffic jam on the road, a blood clot or buildup of plaque in any one spot will restrict the flow of blood and the whole system will become off. But fortunately, there are many surgical procedures nowadays to treat vascular problems which can be serious causing critical complications.

The term vascular disease covers any condition that affects the blood vessels, arteries, veins, and tiny capillaries that carry blood. It also covers the lymphatic system – the small vessels through which the fluid called lymph contains the infection-fighting white blood cells. Vascular disease includes a long list of conditions some of them are also life-threatening such as:

- Aortic aneurysm (thoracic, abdominal)
- Acute venous thrombosis
- Critical limb ischemia
- Carotid artery disease
- Diseases of the aorta
- Diabetes vascular diseases and limb salvage
- Dialysis graft and fistula management
- Peripheral artery disease
- Vascular malformations
- Visceral artery disease
- Thoracic outlet syndrome
- Varicose veins and many more.

Since vascular diseases come with risks, it’s important to get the treatment as soon as possible. If you are worried about financial issues, then you can get a vascular surgery loan from TLC. Vascular diseases become more common with age but know that people with a family history of vascular and heart disease are at a higher risk. Also, pregnant women or anyone who have a cardiac-related condition such as hypertension and high cholesterol have more risks.

Know that an unhealthy lifestyle also can lead to vascular problems among people who smoke or are obese or who routinely stand or sit for a long time. If you are recommended to take the surgery then it’s time to apply for the [vascular surgery loan](https://medical.tlc.com.au/vascular-surgery/). You can use the loan to handle your financial needs. Depending on the severity of the health issues you should take the surgery as soon as possible.

Generally, you will be either recommended to take open surgery or endovascular surgery. In open surgery, the surgeon will make a long incision in order to have direct access to view and treat the health issue. In endovascular surgery, a catheter will be inserted with medications or tiny instruments through the skin and into the blood vessels.

In complex cases, the surgeon will carry out a combination of open surgery and endovascular surgery. Since the vascular issues will result in additional risks, it’s always better to apply for the loan and take the surgery quickly.
