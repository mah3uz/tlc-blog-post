1.  **Overbite –** It is one of the common orthodontic surgery issues. Here, the upper front teeth will extend out over the lower front teeth. This will cause the lower front teeth to bite into the roof of the mouth. In severe cases, it will cause chewing difficulty.
2.  **Underbite –** It is caused when the lower jaw extends out. This will result in lower front teeth sitting in front of the upper front teeth. This will also cause chewing issues.
3.  **Open bite –** It is characterized by lower and upper front teeth that do not overlap. The jaw and the teeth will fail to meet together. This will cause issues in proper chewing and also contribute to tongue thrusting.
4.  **Crossbite –** Here the upper teeth will sit inside the lower teeth. This will result in tooth stratification and misaligned jaw growth. The treatment will help in better-aligned teeth.
5.  **Dental midlines not matching –** This problem will be caused when the back bite does not fit and match correctly. It will negatively impact the jaw and proper dental function.
6.  **Upper front teeth protrusion –** In this type of bite, the upper teeth will extend too far forward or the lower front teeth don’t extend far enough forward. This will cause the lower teeth to grow in a larger size which will cause issues in the future that requires more care.
