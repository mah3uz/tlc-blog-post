# Brachioplasty – What you need to know

You’ve lost the weight. Congratulations, it’s an amazing feeling! For some of us however, we’re left feeling not totally satisfied in the way we look post a big weight loss.

Don’t worry, you’re not alone. A common side effect of losing weight, is the excess and sagging skin that is left behind. The arms in particular, are an area where the skin is notorious for not bouncing back as it should after being stretched and no amount of exercise or diet is going to tighten the loose skin ([Plastic Surgery Hub](https://www.plasticsurgeryhub.com.au/brachioplasty-or-arm-lift-things-you-need-to-know/)).

A **brachioplasty** or an ‘Arm Lift’ reshapes the underside of the upper arm from the armpit to the elbow. The surgery removes the excess skin to give you back that toned and tight look.
