Rhinoplasty is still one of the most popular plastic surgery procedures, and will no doubt continue to be. The nose is one of the most significant parts of the face and whether it’s due to genetics or trauma, having a shapely nose is the reason many undergo plastic surgery. One of the most popular questions we are asked is what’s involved in a rhinoplasty recovery? How long will you need off work? What can you expect? Whilst it goes without saying you should only have your rhinoplasty performed by a specialist, getting the best result possible also involves a good recovery. We chat to Dr George Marcells, a rhinoplasty specialist in Sydney, about what you should look for when choosing your rhinoplasty surgeon and how to have a great recovery and minimise your chances of having a revision.

### Rhinoplasty Recovery

So, what’s involved in a rhinoplasty recovery? Rhinoplasty can be done as a Day Only procedure or if you would prefer, an overnight stay. It is generally agreed that you should arrange to have at least two weeks off work, perhaps more if possible. Some of the reasons for this include:

**• Bruising –** Usually disappears after 10 days  
**• Swelling –** puffy eyes, face and nose for at least a few days. It is estimated to be around 10 – 14 days before most of the swelling and bruising disappears.  
**• You need to minimise movement for a few days –** it is suggested not to return to any strenuous activities for several weeks after your nose job so depending on what job you do you need to take this into consideration.

After surgery, you should expect your nose to feel congested as though you have a cold or the flu. You will probably have a nose splint or cast on your nose to hold it in place and protect it while it heals. Dr Marcells says occasionally you might have internal splints inside the nose as well. He says ‘These should remain in place for at least a week until your nose has stabilised. I always inform my patients about any casts and splints I will use in the procedure at the initial consultation’.

It is advised you should rest as much as possible after the surgery. Keep any movement including housework, work or exercise for at least two weeks. Dr Marcells suggests, ‘Gentle walking is a good way to exercise during this period’.

Dr Marcells also gives us some other hints with regards to the recovery:

• Keep your external splint dry. You can shower, but the water can’t be too hot.  
• If you wear glasses they should not rest on the bridge of your nose.  
• Keep your head up as much as possible. It’s better to sit up, not lie down.  
• Sleep with a couple of pillows to prop you up. Don’t lie flat.  
• Try not to blow your nose during the first week. Gently dab. After any splints and cast is removed you can gently blow your nose again. Definitely don’t wiggle the nose from side to side like we often do when we blow our noses.  
• Try to open your mouth if you sneeze so there’s not too much pressure inside your nose!  
• Ice packs and cold compresses help reduce swelling and bruising around the eyes.  
• Have clothes that button in the front ready for the few days after surgery so you don’t have to pull t-shirts, etc. over your head.  
• If you have young children, try to ensure they don’t knock your nose. Having help from friends or family might be advisable, or explaining to the kids that you need a bit of space for a few days might work too! (Depending on how old or how excitable they are!)

Dr Marcells also advises us that it’s normal to have some bleeding or mucus draining from the nose after the surgery. This often happens for a few days after the surgery. If you feel like it’s excessive or you’re worried about it, or it doesn’t stop after about a week, check back with your surgeon.

Rhinoplasty or nose jobs can completely change the appearance of the patient’s face. However, all the hard work and energy invested in the procedure can be undone by a careless recovery. Taking steps to ensure you are prepared will help maximise your chances of a great recovery and a great result.

If you’d like to arrange a consultation or have any questions, you can phone Dr Marcells and his team on 1300 555 095.
