The clean and renewable nature of solar power has contributed to households adopting solar energy. There are three different types of systems; on-grid solar, off-grid solar and hybrid solar. A decent sized, good quality solar system can cost you in excess of a few thousand dollars, which is definitely not chump change. With TLC you can plan and budget to start making the steps towards having a more renewable lifestyle.
