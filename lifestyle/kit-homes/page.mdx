Kit homes, also known as mill-cut houses or pre-cut houses, is a type of house where most the of major components are pre-fabricated in a factory and then delivered to your site where it will be assembled, hence the name ‘kit home’. In many instances, kit homes are significantly cheaper than waiting for a house to be built from scratch.
