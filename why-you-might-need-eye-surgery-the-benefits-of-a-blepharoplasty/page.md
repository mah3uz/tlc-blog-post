# Why you might need eye surgery – The Benefits of a Blepharoplasty

We all have those moments when we look in the mirror and see a tired face. But what if it’s not just because you had a bad night’s sleep, but because your eyes are permanently droopy or tired looking? [Dr Graham Sellars](https://www.plasticsurgeryhub.com.au/psh-directory/plastic-surgeons/mr-graham-sellars/), Plastic, Cosmetic and Reconstructive Surgeon based at the San Clinic in Wahroonga, NSW has 15 years experience in this type of surgery, so we chatted to him about the reasons why patients come to him for an eye surgery and the benefits of a blepharoplasty.

## Reasons why you might consider a blepharoplasty or eye surgery

Dr Sellars says there are several reasons behind his patients’ motivations for wanting eye surgery.

- Drooping upper eyelid/s (due to age or lifestyle) – also called Ptosis
- Puffiness or bagginess of the lower eyelids and under the eyes
- Compromised vision (gravity can pull the eyelids and skin down so far as to affect your eyesight – this can be dangerous especially when driving)
- Excess skin (again, due to gravity)
- Reduce or remove wrinkles (crow’s feet) and lines due to ageing
- Stop irritation caused by overhanging skin.

[Blepharoplasty](https://www.plasticsurgeryhub.com.au/procedure/eyelid-surgery-blepharoplasty/) can involve an upper eyelid surgery or lower eyelid surgery or both. Dr Sellars says, “The skin is separated from underlying fatty tissue and muscle, removing excess fat and trim sagging skin. Upper eyelid incisions are hidden in natural creases, while lower eyelid incisions usually run just under the eyelash line. Both incisions may extend into the crow’s feet (smile lines) at the outer edge of the eye. Any incisions are then closed with very fine sutures. Surgical scars will be situated in the upper eyelid crease or just under the lower lashes, and are therefore inconspicuous.”

It can result in a more youthful and refreshed appearance and get rid of that [tired or droopy eye](https://www.plasticsurgeryhub.com.au/eye-surgery-success/) look. It can also greatly improve vision if that were an issue (often it is, but we don’t realise it!).

## Is Eye Surgery or Blepharoplasty Covered By Medicare?

It can be depending on your individual circumstances. Dr Sellars expands, “Most insurance companies and Medicare do not cover eyelid surgery unless upper lid skin excess affects or obscures vision. If the upper eyelid skin touches or hangs over the lash/eyelid margin, then Medicare and health insurance companies contribute to the cost of the surgery. We advise patients if this may be the situation for them.”
